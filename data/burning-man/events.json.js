Breathing together is a great way to deepen and bond, so bring your beloved if you choose.\r\n\r\nPlease be sober -- you will not need any additional substance and it can get in the way of your optimal experience. Sovereign Breath creates an altered state in which many experiences are possible facilitated by your higher self. Bring what you most want to release, shift, gain insight about, step into, affirm and create. Be ready for change. This form of breathwork grows out of rebirthing and is a more feminine, gentle and allowing practice than other more aggressive and cathartic forms. This approach makes more effective the integration of your insights and transformation into ordinary reality, and is easier on the nervous system. Deep states of bliss and bonding among participants are common.\r\n\"",

        "description": "The legendary Orgasmatron first came to the playa in 2002, and it provided exceptional physical pleasure to thousands of women in an environment that was safe, comfortable, sensual and private. Six years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.",

        "description": "\"Unfucking Sexuality is about decoupling the sex-craving instincts from the desire to connect intimately. Infinite openness awaits your surrender.\r\n\r\nWhen we can separate our desire for sex from our desire to connect intimately, a canvas of possibility emerges in the space between two hearts where we can truly explore intimacy as art.  \r\n\r\nHuman beings need touch, comfort, safety, love, and intimacy in their lives to feel whole, welcome, complete, and content. Attaining the combination of this cocktail of bliss often is only experienced through a sexual relationship of some kind, and rarely are all of these needs met simultaneously, or by the same person. \r\n\r\nOften, along the path to deepening a relationship or flirtatious connection, one partner or the other begins to dabble with sexual energy through flirting, playful touch, sexy talk, innuendo, or other strategies in an effort to shift the situation into an opening for sexual connection and orgasmic release. \r\n\r\nSexual energy is incredibly powerful, playful, blissful, and transformative, yet it can also be overwhelmingly tricky and even deceitful to one's self and others if not stewarded with care. \r\n\r\nThis workshop explores the fine lines between sexuality and intimacy, between loving touch and sexual touch, and between desire to be with someone intimately and the desire to fuck. \r\n\r\nThrough practicing clear and open communication, bringing awareness to the energy in our bodies and intention in our hearts, and by relaxing into the openness of the moment and surrendering any agenda for where it may be leading, the relational space can be transformed into a mysteriously infinite void of possibilities where literally anything can happen. \r\n\r\nCountless women have confided in me that they are frustrated beyond measure by their partner's (or men in general's) inability to be with them in a way that makes them feel safe, free to express their fullness, and feel loved, cherished, and comfortable in their bodies.",

Reports have come in that these altars are of no spiritual benefit whatsoever. In fact, the consensus among the BMOrg is that the spiritual growth of Burning Man has somehow been stunted. It\u2019s been scientifically proven that the spiritual efficacy of altars is greatly diminished by even trivial amounts of dust. Fortunately, the French Maid Brigade, summoned to task by the BMOrg, is on hand to correct this situation. No matter how much dust your radical ritual kicks up, French Maids will be there to ensure a spiritual journey unencumbered by dust.\r\n\r\nRendezvous with us! You too can be one of the sexiest clean freaks on the playa\u2014please bring: feather dusters, rags, dustbusters, service carts, vacuums, white gloves, latex gloves, enema kits, lube, and any other useful cleaning equipment. Join us in uniform with your surly attitude and worst possible French accent.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday at 2:00 pm we meet at 3 O\u2019Clock and Esplanade then dust our way through every filthy, nasty camp on our march toward that dust bucket known as Center Camp Caf\u00e9, liberate them from their dusty oppression, and celebrate our triumph!",

        "description": "\"High energy beats, massage, up-regulating breathwork, Taoist big draws, awakening energy and intense mind altering sober psychedelic experience.\r\n--\r\n\r\nOften in moments of intense experiences we find answers to solutions we could not access. Benjamin facilitates an experience through high energy beats, partner based massage, up-regulating breathwork, Taoist big draws, and awakening energy with the potential to unlock intense mind altering sober psychedelic experiences. Are you curious?\r\n\r\nThe workshop explores embodiment using one-directional partnered massage. Each set of paired individuals will explore what it means to be in their bodies and fully present while receiving one-directional touch from their chosen giver. If an individual can master blocks in their own body, search for releases, discover new methods, or find hidden gems from being present, it creates a foundation of opportunities that can be unleashed. Some benefits to receiving one-directional touch can be:\r\n\u2022 Self awareness\r\n\u2022 Communication skills\r\n\u2022 Desires & goals\r\n\u2022 Coping with insecurities\r\n\u2022 Decision making\r\n\u2022 Shifting mental states\r\n\u2022 Letting go (aka release)\r\n\u2022 Moving forward\r\n\u2022 Opening doors\r\n\r\nHow to prepare:\r\nThis workshop is partner based or can be experienced solo. A crucial consent, boundaries, and communication section will be covered at the beginning. Individuals will have an opportunity to choose a partner. Please be open to same gender pairings. Triad groups are also encouraged, however one person will not be able to receive due to time constraints. This work can include genital or anal touch, but is not required or expected. You can be fully clothed or naked as when you were born. We mention this so you can be comfortable with others choices in a shared space and define your own boundaries.",

        "description": "As the creator of Pralaya Yoga, Robert Boustany says, \u201cThe PRALAYA YOGA System is continually being optimized to help you develop maximum functional strength, reach the safe extremes of functional flexibility, discover the keys to the best alignment for your body and artfully define the areas that need the most attention.  Pralaya Yoga was developed specifically to support joint longevity as well as to prevent and speed recuperation from the common problems in sports and daily life.\"\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday at 10:AM, we'll gather at General Portrait Studio.  Our 90 minute class will contain some lecture and some practice.  When we finish, you're encouraged to explore their amazing and welcoming camp (Get pictures of your favorite body part, ice cold beverages, great music, Sea Dragon art car, aerial rig, and warm hugs).\r\n\r\nOn our journey, we'll:\r\n     1. Generate Life Energy through Ancient Tibetan breathing techniques.\r\n     2. Find ways to Challenge your Body (safely).\r\n     3. Explore a dozen different ways to Increase Flexibility in a joint.\r\n     4. Discuss the usual cause of any Joint Pain (especially lower back) and how to Avoid/Fix the pain.\r\n     5. Compare and feel the effects of these sacred Pranayamas and Asanas in your own body.\r\n     6. Understand that Pranayamas are ENERGY exercises, not just breathing exercises.\r\n     7. Leave Energized, Elevated and Equipped with new ideas to explore.\r\n\r\nIf you have a mat and/or block, please bring them.\r\n\r\nAll are welcome.  Advanced Yogis Encouraged!\r\n\r\nI promise to challenge you.  Physically, Mentally and Spiritually.\r\n\r\nI look forward to showing you what I\u2019ve learned from my amazing teachers.\r\n\r\nPlease join us!\r\n-Greyson Hawe (Banana Man)",

There is much wisdom in the poly community which can be helpful to people trying to make *any* relationship work, monogamous or Polyamorous. There will be a facilitated discussion in which you can get your questions addressed and some of the knowledge in our community can be shared.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to cool off and de-dust yourself after our tea party, bring a water donation to enjoy PolyParadise's famous Human Carcass Wash.",

This is a safe, fun way to meet new people who are also participating in Open Relating and to gain some practical tools for your relationship or future relationship(s)!\r\n\r\nTo chose to live and relate in an open or polyamorous way requires a community of like-minded souls. Without community we do not have the necessary support we need as couples and individuals to love as big as our hearts desire.\r\n\r\nWhy we each consciously choose to live in alternative ways then the ones that were passed down to us from earlier generations is very personal. Some do it to increase the variety of sexual partners and others do it as a spiritual path to embrace the light and shadow of opening up.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to make it work. Some people have stated agreements meanwhile others rely on embodied principles and some are just totally radical. Regardless of your personal preference, most of us were not raised with role models for this alternative way of relating. So we must come together to role model and mirror one another.\r\n\r\nAs the definition and practice of relating is expanding beyond what we were taught unconsciously by our parents we want to invite you to join the conversation. How do you navigate these waters? What have you found that works? Come just to listen and observe or come to participate and add your own thoughts, questions and perspectives into the conversation.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to share what is most alive in your heart and come join the conversation of open relationships where we aim to come together to create a Culture of Conscious Relating.\"",

This pegging workshop is open to everyone but tailored to female-identifying humans\u2014pegging princesses in training! Regardless of the anatomy with which you were born, sticking things in your ass feels good. In fact, prostate stimulation can produce orgasms up to 10 times stronger and/or more intense than an average genital-stimulation-only orgasm (lucky prostate owners). Pegging is about pleasure plain and simple and humans are enjoying ass play and pegging without shame or stigma now more than ever. Ass play is for everyone! I\u2019ve been ass fucking and blogging my way to pegging princess empowerment for 12 years and want to share my love of all things penetration with you. I LOVE pegging. It makes me feel powerful, sexy, and feminine. I love the view, I love the adoration I get in return, and I love being a part of heightened levels of sexual pleasure for my partner. Pegging need not be about dominating, humiliating, or degrading your partner.  Join me as we leave our fears behind, bring pegging out of the shadows and into the lighter side of kink, and explore safe pegging 101 and beginner equipment. The workshop includes an interactive demonstration, question and answer, and a few surprises. Now let\u2019s rock out with our girl cocks out!",

They firm primarily work with highly-innovative companies that will reshape a given industry or domain.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nMany of their clients are young engineers who suddenly found themselves leading large teams.\u00a0 They needed to learn what \u201cgood leadership\u201d was, identify their blind spots, practice new communication skills, and improve their ability to lead.  After conducting 100s of leadership assessments, the firm has been able to scientifically define what good leadership is when it comes to building teams and innovating in the startup environment.\r\n\r\nIn this interactive presentation, Jason, the firm's cofounder, will share some of their discoveries, how leadership can be defined, and most-importantly, how what we learn by co-creating in community turns out to be the exact same skills that leaders are learning at startups.  \r\n\r\nFestivals like Burning Man are more than just a good time\u2014they are a training ground for leaders, community, and innovation. There\u2019s a reason that many startup leaders go to Burning Man and other festivals. \r\n\r\nTogether, we\u2019ll look at what we have already learned about leadership though our community experiences and how to apply those skills to leadership in the default world.  Everyone in the audience will also receive a self-assessment (printed or online) to identify areas that they could improve.",

Then this workshop is for you!\r\n \r\nIn a fun, creative, interactive way, we are gonna get serious about our collective liberation and what it really takes to make the world a better place. Join us as we dive deep on this facilitated journey of learning tools to deconstruct the current painful and harmful system we live in and rebuild the world we want to see.  This workshop will give you tools to end oppression, pathways to personal and political liberation, and will be rooted in the theme of ritual and will have a liberation ritual component.\r\n \r\nAll genders and backgrounds welcome always!",

RAD maintains a list of ritual augmentation providers and pairs them with ritual events.  Attend office hours or just drop on by and ring the bell for service!  And those wanting to join team RAD Services are invited to contact us!  \r\n\r\nWe at RAD Services aren't going to own/produce/design your ritual. We don't loan/gift equipment to you. What we do is show up in person, with our stuff, and augment/decorate your ritual with visual pizzazz and auditory depth!\r\n\r\nHere is a list of some of the services that we provide (some best in low light venues):\r\n\r\n- LED image painting: Image poi, with is a programmable sticks of LEDs, can trace out any image when moved or spun, e.g., fire, lightening, patterns, words, pictures, etc.  Also, these LED props can produce interesting visual affects even when not moved quickly, e.g., flames, fuses, torches, pulsating lights, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n- Sound: We at RAD are able to provide a wide range of mobile audio support, e.g., music for a parade/procession or clear dialog for weddings or other ceremonies. Our electric trike moves the audio with your moving ritual/parade.\r\n\r\n- Fire: Torches, staff, fire ropes, orbs, poi spinning, etc.\r\n\r\n- Video: Front or back lit video projection can help add a new layer of interest to your ritual. You provide the projection surface (e.g., EasyUp side wall) and we bring the equipment.\r\n\r\n- Blinky: Many props to decorate any low light ritual, including: LED poi (dynamic color changes), LED staff (two image poi brought together), LED image poi (see above), fiber optic whips (think swarm of fire flies).\r\n\r\n- Music: Airy Native American flute background music and parade drum cadence music services are available.\r\n\r\nSo, you come up with the ritual and we at RAD help make it even more awesome. Contact us soon, as our Burning Man 2017 calendar is filling fast.",

        "description": "We invite you to this gathering of Spiritually Minded, Open, Fluid, LGBTQ, Polyamorous, Polysensuous, Polycurious, Monogamomish people. This is a safe, fun way to meet new people who are also participating in Open Relating and to gain some practical tools for your relationship or future relationship(s)!\r\n\r\nTo chose to live and relate in an open or polyamorous way requires a community of like-minded souls. Without community we do not have the necessary support we need as couples and individuals to love as big as our hearts desire.\r\n\r\nWhy we each consciously choose to live in alternative ways then the ones that were passed down to us from earlier generations is very personal. Some do it to increase the variety of sexual partners and others do it as a spiritual path to embrace the light and shadow of opening up.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to make it work. Some people have stated agreements meanwhile others rely on embodied principles and some are just totally radical. Regardless of your personal preference, most of us were not raised with role models for this alternative way of relating. So we must come together to role model and mirror one another.\r\n\r\nAs the definition and practice of relating is expanding beyond what we were taught unconsciously by our parents we want to invite you to join the conversation. How do you navigate these waters? What have you found that works? Come just to listen and observe or come to participate and add your own thoughts, questions and perspectives into the conversation.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to share what is most alive in your heart and come join the conversation of open relationships where we aim to come together to create a Culture of Conscious Relating.",

Taking motivation from this year's Burning Man theme, we thought we would tap into a the Radical Ritual and play with a fun concept...\r\n\r\nStarting the day with spirituality, we end the day with incredible music. After leaving the first new moon of spring behind, we finalised our program and created a daytime/nighttime 12 hours program of our dreams.\r\n\r\n12:00 - 13:00\r\nWe start the day with our community college. We are constantly attracting new roads to explore. We hear friends talk about life changing experiences. We read articles on different ways of life. It leads to so many questions. What is ayahuasca? Should I do Vipassana? Why does Sting love tantric sex? Our community college invites inspirational speakers to provide information on interesting topics. Join this talk, be inspired or just listen to the many wonders of the world.\r\n\r\n13:00 - 14:00\r\nAs we gather in the desert for more than a week, we take the opportunity of this event to ground you, in the desert. Take a moment to step away from the outside world and connect with your home. A beautiful guided meditation accompanied by a celestial communication followed by a cleanse. Not only will this spiritual ceremony set the energy for the rest of our day, it will offer you so much light the rest of the week.\r\n\r\n14:00 - 00:00\r\nAs we slowly move from our spiritual self into our spiritual animal, we've created a musical program to get those who are passing by stop and dance. Our camp members are completely transformed into wild performers, face painters, tantric masseuses and more.",

Once visitors receive their Yes. Now. Please. stamps verifying their age, they enter the GameBar.  The GameBar games are a mash-up of twister, musical chairs, and hot lava.  Stools, tables and counters are spread out over a platform.  Each stool has a different color and colored spots are on the bar, the floor, the monkey bars overhead and even the swings on the edge.  Some stools even have numbers or symbols.  The bartender picks from a stack of overly large cards to find out what happens next (or they can just make up a new rule!).  For example, It could be that all people sitting on yellow seats have to go to a blue seat, but they can\u2019t touch the ground, hot lava!  They must climb over and around people, keeping hold of their drinks, of course!  They may have to get a partner and find seats that add up to a certain number.  They may need to have a hand on a certain color and the butts on a different color.  They may have to sit on the bar, hang from the monkey bar, sit on the monkey bar, one foot on a swing, one hand on...the bartender themselves!  There are so many versions and iterations of different rules that the fun is endless.   The patrons will be encouraged, through the cards, to interact with each other as well as those in the street.  There are no points and not even a goal of the game other than to share in the fun and make some new friends!\r\nBartenders wear matching twister-themed outfits and carry super soaker water guns filled with a tasty cocktail.  There is no \u201cbar\u201d in our bar unless you count the monkey bar!  The bartenders roam around the platform, serving our special blend to the patrons.  \r\n \r\nThe GameBar will be open Monday - Saturday 5pm - 9pm for happy hour game time.",

To witness. To be witnessed. A choice to see and be seen as we are and in our highest self When we gather with intention, we gather and increase in said powers. This will be such a gathering... ...and in such times and at such gatherings true magic, transformation, renewal and clarity through spaciousness are even more possible, even more accessible, for that tribal heart intention is an almost irresistible force for ourselves individually and collectively. This heart centered gathering is a simple but profound Puja (Devotional) ceremony of seeing and being seen first in silence, then with witnessing, listening and sharing, so that we may open to the possibility of falling in love with ourselves either directly or through the eyes of another. I invite you to be vulnerable. To see and be seen in this moment. To open to the beautiful reflections in each other. Come to this gathering because you are READY to step up into your full expression. Ready to be the Strong Man and a Powerful Woman who has the right to be met, and the right to love and be loved.\r\n\r\n\"",

Switch partners, or keep the same partner. If you don't have a partner (odd groups), just sit with the energy and sensations of those around you. Form a small circle and hold hands. Take a few breaths together. Begin a ritualistic undressing and go around in the circle. For each article of clothing one removes, say any fear aloud to the group. Repeat until all clothes removed. Take a moment to reconnect with your partners through eye contact. Ask permission (consent) to paint on your partner's body. You may switch roles, paint each other and the same time, or decide to stay in one role the entire time. Paint without thinking (Automatism). Just paint. Just be. \"",

All relationships, every shape and size, have the ability to lead us deeper into the mystery of who we truly are. \r\n\r\nWhere we are the most vulnerable, we have the strongest defenses. And it just so happens, we are the most vulnerable in our intimate and romantic relationships. \r\n\r\nSo... \r\n\u0ed1 How do we handle the strong instincts that kick in when we are triggered? \r\n\u0ed1 What to do when we are overwhelmed and projecting our past fears on the future? \r\n\u0ed1 Is there an alchemical relational process that makes gold out of led? \r\n\u0ed1 Can we transform our wounds, the most ugly aspects in us and our protective instincts, into an even deeper intimacy? \r\n\u0ed1 Can we unshackle biology and conditioning so that we can be truly free to love?\r\n\r\nDuring this 3 intensive we will guide you through simple and effective ways to come back to love, to transform what keeps you small and to take brave steps into all that you are. We will use practices such as Belly2Belly and other Relational & Embodiment Practices.",

We will participate in some collaborative movement exercises and discussion that help us become more eloquent and connected to ourselves, to the other, and to how we feel and express about conSensual dance culture.\r\n \"",

Informational/experiential workshop for couples with at least one female!\r\n\r\nInspired by Naomi Wolf's Vagina (her book, not the real thing). So if no-one's told you, or you haven't noticed yet, men and women are different! Just how different, particularly in sexual response, is only recently being discovered by western science. The famous study of sexuality in the swinging sixties by Masters and Johnson was largely about male sexuality and in a stunning failure of the scientific method they kinda assumed women were pretty much the same......\"\"two arms, two legs, a head, yeah, I think they're pretty much going to react the same way....\"\" without actually finding out until 50/60 years later!\r\n\r\nBut there are and have been more enlightened cultures than ours on these matters. It turns out that some eastern cultures had got a very detailed handle on female sexuality thousands of years ago. Ancient tantric teachings turn out to be not a set of arcane practises based on spiritual mumbo jumbo but precise systems of activating the fullness of the feminine sexual response, now being verified by the latest research in neuroscience in the west.\r\n\r\nWolf calls this range of specific stimulations the Goddess Array, and I shall attempt to describe the steps that every woman needs that men don't need and create a container for you to experience the majority of them in one of Naked Heart's carpeted domes. \r\n\r\nPlease bring nesting materials and a secret gift for your goddess.",

Now, returning from Standing Rock to Black Rock, we come together with global synchronised prayer platform Unify, and cultural force Mayan Warrior, to continue the prayer that started at Standing Rock.\r\n\r\nFor generations, Native American culture has held that the drum is the heartbeat of Mother Earth, and the water, her veins.  Indigenous tribes use drums in various ways to interact with a higher power, known to many as The Great Spirit.  Drums are the channel we use to connect to our spirit, to each other, and to the spirit of Earth. Water is sacred.  MNI WICONI!\r\n\r\nThe historic, global gathering of hundreds of tribes at Standing Rock standing together for the first time for our water has been prophesied for these times.  Now, we gather under the Medicine Wheel of all nations to carry this prayer forward.  It has been said that peace will not come to our Earth until the circle of humanity is complete; until all four colours sit in circle under the Medicine Wheel and share their teachings. \r\n\r\nCome and experience our unification as a human family as we dance together under the Medicine Wheel to the beat of the drum, playing out to all of Black Rock City on the Playa's best sound-system.  Pray with us on the Playa or engage with us online as we stream our prayer out to over 15 million people using Unify's platform. Join us.  Together, we pray for good health and better understanding.  Together, we pray for deep listening.  Together, we pray for unity, for peace, and for love. \r\n\r\nThis is a historic moment you won't want to miss.\r\n\r\nThis is our Radical Ritual.",

Experience ways to get more out of these interactions than you ever thought possible!\r\n\r\nMost people avoid eye contact, especially prolonged, and are pretty uncomfortable in a long embrace. Is it any wonder? Did you ever take a class in either of these? Was physical and emotional intimacy part of your schooling? Has anyone ever shown you or taught you HOW to do these things? No. Our culture could care less about how we demonstrate love and affection for one another. That's for the birds, right? Well, no. Women need face to face eye contact with their mates on a daily basis to feel relaxed. They need to be seen. And everyone needs to be touched, lovingly and respectfully, with consent. It is up there with oxygen, so come and learn some tips and tricks how to be a better hugger and a more relaxed, er...looker!\"",

Whatever it is and wherever it fits in the pantheon of carnal pleasures, there is one sure fire way of experiencing it. Offer it as a service to others!

Every 8 mins I ring a bell and receivers get to wander the Spa and choose another offering. After an hour, the receivers write down a whole new set of Tantra Spa delights, now inspired by what they've seen, heard and experienced and the former givers now get chance to sample the menu as receivers.\"",

        "description": "Touch is a vital part of whom we are, how we interact with the world, and most importantly how you connect with a partner or loved one. Many of us have engaged in sensual touch with a lover or tickling at a young age, but are you aware of how well the two can work together to make an amazing sensory experience with someone? Whether it is tickling to tears, to moans of delight, or simply squirming Domme Kelli Lynn Sage and Bagelfather are well versed in this and will be leading this class in sensual touch and the art of tickling with a partner. We have learned the ropes over the years and want to pass our wisdom on to you. We will instruct you, with the help of audience volunteers, in the art of tickling and sensual touch. \r\n\r\nWe will also cover consent, basic bondage, negotiation, safe words, having a positive relationship with kink, as well as touching. This event is for those 18 years old and over (please bring your ID if you look young). People of all gender identities are welcome to attend. It is best if you can come with a partner so you can practice some of what you learn, if you come alone we cannot guarantee to partner you up with someone. We recommend bringing a towel or something similar to lay on the ground to sit on. In addition we ask that you be respectful of all participants and remind you to ask before touching someone that you have not made arrangements before hand.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to volunteer ahead of time email Bagelfather@gmail.com, also feel free to let us know before we start if you are interested in demonstrating.",

TFL is what I see happening within connected partnerships when we listen, respond, allow ourselves to be inspired and share our own voice. My belief is that investigating these principals will give us the tools to create more dances in the \u201cSWEET SPOT\u201d, where your brain gets to shut off and you body moves with grace.\r\nIf you have never dance before, Gina will take you though exercises that will give you the confidence to move with another person. \r\nAnd, if you are an accomplished dancer from any genre consider this your cross training. Gina will be exposing  you to concepts that will take your dance to the next level. Specifically giving you some tools to enable you to have connection and conversation with all levels of dancers. \r\nCome play with us!",

After a long night on the playa wouldn\u2019t you like a \u201cschmoke und a pancake? No?\u201d Well then, how about a blintz!\r\n \r\nWhat is a blintz?  It\u2019s like a crepe, only tastier and more transportable, something quintessential when it comes to all the lightning-quick decisions you have to make on the playa.  A blintz is one standard-issue crepe pancake combined with a sweet, cottage cheese-like filling (or a savory potato and onion filling) that is then rolled into a small burrito-like form to fit nicely in the palm of your hand. Delicious!\r\n \r\nCome groove with the camp and ask your skilled blintz chefs for the latest flavor, and hang around in our shade structures to meet other hungry travelers. Blintzes will be offered every day from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, or until we\u2019re out of blintzes",

The most interesting practice would be turning your thoughts inward for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy. I'll be happy if we could find any great idea to make a brighter, better, and more enjoyable future through this tea ceremony.",

Our method of creating ice cream harnesses the effort of the community.  We invite the entire Burning Man community to participate in the ice cream making process.  We ask the individuals who wish to receive our gift of ice cream to create the ice cream, by stirring the ice cream mix and the liquid nitrogen.   Those individuals also get to bathe in the cool air generated by the ice cream making process.  Everyone is welcome to hang out in our chill space - to relax and meet new and old friends.  We find making and eating ice cream in the harsh desert environment creates a shared surreality that can only be experienced by those who visit WeScream.",

        "description": "'The Divine Masculine and Feminine Healing Circle' is an event where the men of the playa are invited to step into their higher selves, and consciously hold the energy of the Divine Masculine. Josie Posie leads a ceremony where the women of the playa welcome the men lovingly at the entrance to the dome, inviting them to match the high vibration they hold. The dome becomes an Ancient temple space. The men then stand in a circle offering unconditional love and healing to the community of women who gather in the center. The women come for healing their trust of the Masculine and to receive their love. This is a hands-off workshop. There is no touching except optional hugging at the end. When men show up and become the pure presence of their Divine Masculine nature and truly witness, then women can relax into their loving Divine Feminine nature and fully become that love. As both polarities open to their Divine essence, we transmute cultural wounds in the collective feminine and masculine for all of humanity, co-creating a needed and beautiful new story of balance.",

Honoring that our type of wombyn is the first generation of its kind, built from the efforts of our fore mothers and ancestors, we will give thanks and give way to what has to come next to keep progressing. \r\n\r\nNow that we are these powerful juicy GWADDESSES, what now? \r\n\r\nHere is a space where Muse will lead you through teachings and practices, not to mention you receiving or teaching super delicious technique, to go back into your lives not only fully liberated wombyn, but now more INTEGRATED wombyn! \"",

Utilizing the core tools of Tantra: Breath, Sound, Movement and Touch we slow way down to be together, just as we are. Drop in all the way, fully into your body. Down, in, open and relax. Feel the fullness that arises from within. Breathe deeply into your sovereign experience. Land, ground into your sense of self and feel your boundaries in relation to others.\r\nMeeting and greeting new people in a festival environment is inherently exciting and anxiety provoking. From a survival standpoint we are testing strangers before we invite them in. So in this collective field of unlimited interactive potential, how do we honor the wisdom of our bodies while connecting with others and with what wants to happen? When animals are safe they play, so do we. \"",

(Due to the time constraint, we will ask that people sign up for a time slot in advance). Our trained barista, Kyle, will provide guests with coffee samples to give them that boost of energy for the night. Nurse Rico will be on hand to make sure you are hydrated at our hydration station. Our resident DJs will provide you with funky beats for you to begin your night with dancing under our disco ball. Our trained bartenders will be serving magical cocktails (and mocktails). The Never-Land Disco Spa will run from 8 - 10 PM on Thursday night. We can't wait to pamper you.",

The extinguishing of this Sacred Fire marks the closing of our week-long ceremony at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nHow have you learned to appreciate fire during our ceremony together? \r\nHow have you learned to work with the spirit of the fire?\r\nHow will you carry this prayer forward, and back to your communities? How will you keep your own Sacred Fire lit? How will you continue to shine your light in the darkness?\r\n\r\nFire feeds the seeds of intention of what we seek to call forth. Fire is also a purifier. Send everything that no longer serves you into your own Sacred Fire to purify your heart, body, mind, and soul.  Keep the memory of what occurred this year during our Radical Ritual with you, and bring it back to your community.",

Where we are the most vulnerable, we have the strongest defenses. And it just so happens, we are the most vulnerable (and reactive) in our intimate and romantic relationships. In this playful workshop we will utilize a simple map of the nervous system. Learn who shows up to our rescue when we are triggered (into primal instincts such as Fight, Flight, Freeze, Submit, and Cry for help). We drop below the thinking mind into the wisdom of the body. To a depth from where it is easy and simple to relate most intimately. Here we drop the guard and lead with the last thing we want our partner to know about us. Vulnerably revealed, 100% responsible, allowing yourself be seen as you are, unedited, undefended, raw and exposed. This is the quickest way to intimacy and how to create healing relationships that honor the intelligence of our body, emotions and intellect.",

        "description": "Autogenic Training (AT) involves repetitions of a set of visualizations that induce a state of relaxation. AT has been shown to be an effective tool in preventative medicine, stress-related disorders and panic attacks. It can relieve tension, lessen anxiety, and enhance performance. As the world's first western developed mediation technique, AT is a neurological and psycho-physiological tool or therapy for psychological and medical self-healing. \r\n\r\nAT takes you through a series of validated and prescriptive mental exercises that target specific physiological reactions in the brain and body that underpin optimal health and well-being. Through the power of self-suggestion you are taught how to consciously and intentionally control your Autonomic Nervous System. AT is for anyone who wants to benefit from gaining the self-help tools to manage stress in the present and to develop long term strategies to reduce stress and anxiety. It is also of benefit for qualified or trainee psychotherapists who wish to gain a deeper trust in their relationship with 'self' and for those in the caring professions who want to learn new techniques for self-care. The technique was developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz and first published in 1932. \r\n\r\nEach session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures (for example, lying down, sitting meditation, sitting like a rag doll).On a micro level of regeneration, Autogenics retrains cells, glands, the brain and organs to behave as they are \u2018meant to\u2019, that is, to work in harmony and to restore the natural order. We are now coming to understand AT\u2019s role in neuro-plasticity, gut health, epigenetic modulation and the placebo response. The future for AT world-wide in becoming a mainstream therapy for the self-regulation of body-mind healing and optimal functioning is exciting!",

        "description": "Transfoamation is an interactive perfoamance camp which prompts citizens of BRC to ponder self-awareness and investigate the sources of their identity through the examination of perspectives on gender, sociofomo status, race and privilege.  Set in a post Refoamation environment, our theme from last year which asked people to confess their environmental sins to animals and experience life behind bars, this year\u2019s Transfoamation involves a multi-stage process developed in conjunction with LGTBQ community which will highlight person-to-personal exercises diving into identity as participants queue up. After completing all prefoamation rituals to join our Tranfoamation they will shed their old dusty selves and clothing, enter our transfoam chamber, and ascend to the final stage of their actual Transfoamation to oneness with the universe and their fellow human in the transblastive foam experience. \r\n\r\nTransfoamation will take place daily starting on Wednesday and ending on Saturday at 12:00 -1:00pm for children under 13, 1:00 - 4:20pm for all people of all ages. We are usually located near 2:15/G. \r\n\r\nTransfoamation is also the home base of an amazing community that services the city 24 hours a day in a number of ways.  Besides the wonder of a daily personal Transfoamation we offer, the camp serves as the home base of the volunteer professionals working with the Zendo project that provides psychological harm reduction services across the BRC.  We host trainings for Zendo staff in our camp and run a 400 plate per meal kitchen connected to the Transfoamation and Zendo.  We will have a midday hydration area at the exit of our Transfoam Dome run by our camp as well. Also part of the Transfoam camp is the Abraxas Mutant vehicle team.\r\n\r\nOur camp changes it's name every year. Previous years we have been called Refoamation, Something Freaky This Way Foams, Fauxmirage, UFOm, Faux Mitzvah, Foamo Aragato, and Foam Saves.",

In 2014 we took the world cup to playa with a little twist, no nations, no flags, just the joy for the sport\u2026 at a very fancy stadium. In 2015 and 2016 we had a professionally measured futbol 5 field.\r\n\r\nWe do take special care of the field the whole year in order to have one of the  best sport arenas of Black Rock City.  Following the radical inclusion rule,  many other sports are practiced at the stadium during the day. Tejo, track and field, bola criolla, handball/footbal, saltimbanqui are just some, to name a few.",

        "description": "We're throwing a Patronus Party! Come out to Champagne Campaign for an awesome day party with music, dancing and champagne! Costumes encouraged! Harry Potter nerds welcome! \r\n\r\nWhy Patronus and not sspirit animal? Spirit animal is a culturally appropriated term which bastardized an important and significant Native American spiritual practice into white girls calling Lindsay Lohan their spirit animal as she crashes her car drunk with Coke all over her nose. Patronus is the non-offensive Harry Potter originated word that is the animal that forms at the end of your wand to protect against dementors. #themoreyouknow \r\n\r\nNot sure what your Patronus is? Here's an easy quiz to find out: https://tinyurl.com/lx2k7rz\r\n\r\nFor the past nine years, a Seattle-based group of friends have been traveling to Burning Man, spreading the love of Burning Man upon return, and growing larger with each burn. In 2016, Champagne Campaign was first officially placed as a registered theme camp. The universal activity enjoyed by this group of friends is meeting at 12:00 in front of the temple every sunrise for a champagne toast to the new day. This group of friends has continued the sunrise tradition at home in Seattle, and plans sunrise champagne events during the summer. At Burning Man, Champagne Campaign is an interactive camp that hosts daily debates in a campaign-esque setting. Our champagne bar is open during debate hours to encourage lively debates paired with champagne party punch. We encourage lively debates where people are free to give their opinion no matter the absurdity and engage themselves among burners of all different backgrounds and opinions. Champagne Campaign returns to Burning Man in 2017 in that hopes that it will continue to be an interactive inclusive theme camp for years to come on playa as well as in Seattle. All proceeds go to getting our camp to the playa and stocking our bar so we can gift the joy of champagne all week long!",

Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It\u2019s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits.

Our nearby bar, The Rusty Speculum, is open from noon to midnight.

Swat a sperm-shaped tether ball, pass through a leaky condom, jump over a big freakin\u2019 bible, through a coat hanger, climb a set of stairs to nowhere, chill in the womb. \r\nCulminates in a slide through a giant vagina where you are re-birthed near the bar and greeted with heckling encouragement and a possible spank on the bottom from a genuine playa doctor. During clinic events, our camp members will guide canal visitors: If you need lube or a slap on the ass we are there for you. But the experience stands alone at any time of day or night.

Now hosting ersatz Playa Weddings for the nuptially needy of Black Rock City for our (lucky!) seventh consecutive year, EWC welcomes individuals, couples, trios and other configurations without regard to race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, species or any other limiting factor. The Moist Rev. L. Ron Presley, assisted by the Good Rev. Bubba Ho-Tep, officiates over a variety of custom-tailored ceremonies, each climaxed by the dramatic revelation of the spirit of Lord Elvis--as embodied by the amazing, life-size, audio-anatomically accurate ELBOT 2000. But first, teams of trained fashion experts will outfit the bride, groom and attendants in dazzling Playa finery from among plentiful options in our legendary Bridezilla Lounge! Hours: 2 p.m. to Sunset daily, Monday through Friday. Mass Wedding Celebrations begin at 5 p.m. on Final Friday!",

When a woman is economically independent and wields the energy of money powerfully, she shines her light to the fullest, thereby elevating the Feminine and healing the planet. The current state of the world we live in - war, social issues, environmental destruction, financial crises - reflects the distortion & dominance of the Masculine. Nothing has been more devastating to the evolution of our collective consciousness towards a higher state of oneness, love, and cooperation. Let's stop perpetuating the repression of the feminine by settling for less and being less Goddess than we are.",

        "description": "\"BOTH genders are welcome in this gender fluid workshop!\r\n\r\n(The terms female/women or male/men are used loosely indicating people who self identify as male or female.)\r\n\r\nIn this last year and a half I have been delving into sexuality and examining societal beliefs around intimacy. It has become clear to me that sexuality is a fast track to discovering the blind spots which hinder us from intimacy. One of the most fruitful areas of exploration for myself has been in the area of male to male intimacy and gender fluidity. Through my experiences i have found that most men are guarded in ways that protect them from experiencing doubt around their own male sovereignty. For example most of us have been taught that to be affectionate with other males is wrong and means that we are \"\"homosexual\"\" or weak. \r\n\r\nA recent study by Harvard shows that humans are actually gender fluid and most of our gender identity is indoctrinated into us through our family systems, society, and the media. \r\n\r\nThe fruit which comes from exploring male to male intimacy on an energetic and physical level is that all of our male armor/guarded defense systems vanish and we develop a greater level or capacity for intimacy with all people including women. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the workshop allows men to explore their relationships with their fathers, brothers and friends and then moves gently towards male to male affection, culminating in energetic play with sexual energy. This is not a clothing optional work shop, personal boundaries will be respected all of the time, and personal safety a priority! Participants will always be at choice and have a multitude of different opportunities with which to explore this theme. Women will hold space and at times participate in this exploration and benefit from observing what occurs in the room. \r\n\r\nGratitude and blessings\r\n\r\nTimothy\"",

Come learn from a professional enjoyable skill.\u00a0 Forged out of the eons of Deep Time and raw forces of Nature, a uniquely shaped and smoothed river stone awaits your unique curiosity in an ephemeral moment of creative exploration. We supply you with the stone, paint and guidance; you supply your awareness, vision, and imagination. Together on your planetary journeys, after 4.5 billion years, you and the river stone meet. Silly or profound, the colors or imagery are all a part of the play on the Playa. Will your rock become a bug, a power object, a flower, or a psychedelic paisley? Experienced art teachers can help with color mixing, brush technique, and concept execution. Create a memory to keep or offer as a gift.",

As a first generation East Indian woman, physician, and mystic, I have battled through my own psyche to find clarity that I revere as a guide for my being in this world.  The spiritual crisis has been a fundamental struggle, as my life has been a search for identity in a new culture that clashes fiercely with that of my native heritage.  While India is vibrant with with fragrance, texture, sound, and color, a constant sensory exploration,  America has been overworked and desensitized by violence, oppression, ignorance, and suffering.  Initially a victim of this plight, Great Spirit ultimately granted the gifts of True Wisdom.  However, integration from the expansive awakening of unity consciousness to the mundane experience of ordinary life is no small task.  From the strength of humanity and the love of true friendships to miracles and the cosmic vibration found in the echoes of stillness, this is a story of that wonderful journey.",

        "description": "We are Clue Bar.\r\n\r\nWe will host the bar from 3:30- 5:30 pm Monday - Friday and our murders will occur on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, at the same time.\r\n\r\nTuesday Theme: Murder under the Big Top (Circus)\r\nWednesday Theme:  Highschool Homecoming\r\nFriday Theme:  Santa's Workshop\r\n\r\nThis will mark our second year on the Playa as Clue Bar and we murder people.\r\nTo date we've murdered about a dozen people.  Okay not really, but we pretend murder them at murder mystery parties.  So we thought, why not bring this kind of fun home with us?\r\n\r\nWe will host at three scheduled murders through-out the week, each being about an hour and a half event. Everyone gets a character to play and clues to help solve the murder. There is an emcee that keeps things moving along but this is performance art in its rawest form, everyone is a suspect (or the recently deceased) and it is up to the group to collaborate, negotiate shady agreements, blackmail or otherwise enjoy themselves.\r\n\r\nEach murder requires twenty people to play the roles for each murder we commit.  Each murder has a theme; a Circus, Santa's Workshop and an 80's Homecoming murder.  We encourage participants to come in costume and/or fully embrace their character.  We're snarky too so if people need a clue right there on the spot, a clue will be written for them and handed over in a small envelope.  A sample clue would be: \"Shave your goatee, with a knife, to get more pussy, in the lounge, you fucking hippie.\"  It's a silly good time and everyone gets drunk or hydrated, meets new people and whether they crack the case or not they win shit for best actor, best briber, best sleuth, best dressed.\r\n\r\nOn the days we're not committing foul play we will host a bar and a water hydration station (a giant igloo dispenser available throughout the entire day, filled with Earth20 from Bend, Oregon and chilled with a block of ice).",

I have developed this discussion over the last two years to work with interested discussants to come to understanding over some of the \"trigger\" words used in discussions of race, privilege and, diversity. I have done this talk twice with Flipzens, once at GLC, twice at neighborhood venues, and once in a private home. \r\n\r\nThis discussion is designed to give participants a safe place to speak about a very tough topic. We unpack the origins of some of the tough \"trigger\" words like Privilege & Racism by looking at their origins, academic intention, and the ways the words have been bastardized in popular culture. I use humor and a conversational attitude to help steer a fairly participant driven discussion. during which I take a fair amount of comments and questions from others. This gives participants the feeling of having been part of of discussion rather than having been lectured at. It seems to help.",

Wear your groovy (and warm!) duds that show off your spirit of the 60\u2019s and beyond, and take a trip through Pepperland and memory land! Enjoy popcorn and refreshments while you sing along with fellow fans! It\u2019s a grand vocal jam. - Some years ago on the Playa, we had a total blast when a spontaneous chorus broke out in our camp, covering classic songs, and an annual tradition was born. We\u2019re updating that tradition as we gather this year to sing timeless Beatles and classical standards tunes with/without accompaniment. Everyone\u2019s invited and welcomed! It ain\u2019t over \u2019til it\u2019s over!",

The purpose of this workshop is to educate and enlighten those interested in knowing more about this 3% of the public that few understand. This workshop seeks to help transphobic people in a non-judgmental way. The very basic definition transphobia, is simply being frightened of trans-folks because of misunderstandings or lack of education on all things trans. This is often because the questions you\u2019ve always wanted to ask, are taboo; making it difficult to learn, understand, and honor the transgender path. Open to all. \r\n\r\nTrans 101: The Nuts and Bolts.\r\nA brief PowerPoint discussion of definitions and the basics of gender, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. How are transgender and cisgender people alike? How are they different?\r\n\r\nTrans 201: A Peak Through the Veil.\r\nAfter learning the basics, we\u2019ll have a Q&A session where any and all questions will be fielded. We all know that there are questions that are deemed inappropriate to ask a transperson. For this brief moment in time, there are no taboos. We will do our best to answer your questions with honesty, transparency, and sincerity.\"",

However, we will be using polymer or sculpey baking clay for this project using a traditional rolled cane method for our design. Fun way to learn and take home a new skill as well create a pretty wearable piece of art. All skill levels welcome, subject of the design TBD based on consensus and or skill level of the class :) We plan to then bake the beads after the class. They can be worn on necklaces or crafted into buttons so feel free to bring your own necklace material, twine, or pins to attach to the polymer clay. Plan to spend about 45min to an hour creating your beautiful beads and approximately an additional 20 minutes for bake time in our ovens! All ages and skill levels welcome. Clay will be provided but feel free to bring your own if you brought some by chance to the playa. Due to limited supplies/tools and seating (unless you bring your own supplies and tools), the class will be first come first serve.",

It will be primed and ready for you to get your art on! As the week goes by the wall will evolve into a community mural for the citizens by the citizens! \r\nAll individuals, whether master artists or stick figure lovers, are invited to participate. Paint as much as you like or observe from our viewing bench.\r\nWe will supply all brushes and paint for the wall. Basic painting instruction will be provided if requested. Music will be playing from behind the wall so you can dance along with the colors as you choose. Lights will be on for evening viewing (or painting if we stay open late). The wall will be open for creativity Monday - Friday 10am and stay open until 6pm (or later).\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the wall will be dismantled. Each of the 8 individual canvases which comprised the wall will be randomly gifted to citizens of the community.

Born literally from a dream after returning from Burning Man about ten years ago, my vision embraced the core of the human body - the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine and the visible line of the Inguinal Ligament. A dream of dancers, hoopers, fire spinners and burners moving in every manner of human endeavor on the Playa and always the ASIS supporting the human form with such graceful, sensual strength. The Playa ASIS Project will attempt to capture the absolutely unique core of the individual in context of the Burning Man experience. This is not genital photography and we will limit identifying markers to your ASIS. Final artistic discretion will remain with the photographer.\r\nThis ASIS project will have a stationary location in our camp's community monkeyhut space on Tues. and Thurs. from 12pm to 2pm, but will also be roaming the playa with a photo wagon Mon., Wed. and Fri. Photos taken will be used for a anonymous encyclopedia of playa ASIS. Subjects will only be photographed if they choose to be part of the project. No records are kept on participants making the photos essentially anonymous.",

It's Mirror Man and Patti from Earth Guardians providing you with just what you need, or, just what the doctor ordered, as it were.  You can have it black or, until we run out, with some evaporated milk and or Stevia.  We've been doing this for a few years.  We bring burnable paper cups, but if you have your own cup, that's even better.  What's really cool is if you can bring an authentic reproduction tin cup (get them from 19th-Century reenactment vendors, like C & D Jarnagin or James County Mercantile).  We're usually on the west side - Look for a table, red wagon behind a a red Trek mbike, blue enamel-ware coffee pots boiling away, a tallish thin lady and a tall guy with a black slouched hat, kind of looking like a 19th Century 49er or maybe one of the 1st Cav guys who patrolled this region 155 years ago - and who had hot coffee like we'll be serving you...!",

Pharmakon, open M-F mornings, 11am-1pm from, is the yourt \"Oh, gawd!\" hangover recovery station, replete with a full menu of tried and true playa picker uppers. \r\n\r\nThis year we have broadened Pharmakon\u2019s offerings to include simple first aid items for (hapless) virgin burners who find themselves unprepared. We have found even seasoned burners can be surprised by the fragility of their bodies in our dusty wonderland. By offering various OTC remedies we hope to mitigate trivial demands on Rampart medical services and provide a gentle lesson in self-sufficiency along with the bandaid and a hug. (Unfortunately we will no longer be offering ameliorative trepanning or exorcisms as we broke the skull drill and drank all the holy water). \r\n\r\nFATHER JACK'S PANTY SHACK offers solace for souls experiencing that \u2018not so fresh\u2019 feeling. Eager participants in need of a little freshening up can score a dainty thong, beefy briefs or a naughty hybrid that tap dances on the line between decency and profane. You never know what you\u2019ll find when you put your hand inside the box of mystery but we can promise you\u2019ll get rousing applause, catcalls and possibly even a consensual reacharound as you model your new underoos for our staff of helpful shackmasters.",

The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality. You don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to get there. The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. How? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory \"hooks\" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel \"good.\u201d We will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process. After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group. We look forward to sharing your future day together. Dr. Feelgood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 45 Minute Meditation Session is 2PM M-F and followed up with creative cocktails, step up and have a feel good drink at our Camp Feel Good Compliment Bar/Sherpa Foot washing station!\r\n\r\nFor those in need of a deep dive in what you want out of life, we offer an Advice Booth Open every day!",

It is difficult to identify the genre of this theatre's stagings (as the word \"genre\" in itself implies some kind of traditionalism) and perhaps the company's style is closest to modern choreography in its most nonconformist form. The shows tell no story, reveal no plot, have no dimensions, or narrative. Rather, they mirror reality through dreams, bordering on that thin line between the outer and the inner worlds that interacts with the spectator through their own intuition or unconsciousness. As in the 'absolute mirror', every single person should see in each their work, an inner world and their own particular destiny. \r\nblackSKYwhite has received important awards for innovation in theater at FringeFirst - the international performing arts festival in Edinburgh, Scotland and have headlined performances at Glastronbury Festival. They have performed at Burning Man 2010 also.",

He will then show us the intriguing inter-workings of the human endocannabinoid system, our body's system of natural \"cannabis-like\" molecules.  He will fascinate us with the latest research and science on the health effects of this unique plant.  And he will end with a vision for how cannabis users can help accelerate cannabis research by becoming citizen scientists and donating their data to researchers.",

        "description": "Recent advances in psychedelic science are poised to fundamentally change our approach to mental health and human wellness.  I\u2019ll present the latest in research from NYU and the growing field of research with psychedelic plants and medicines.  Then I\u2019ll present results from our study of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for clinical anxiety and distress among cancer patients, which was featured on the front page of the New York Times.  The findings suggest that a single-dose of psilocybin produced rapid and robust anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects, with large magnitude between-group effect sizes at six weeks.  These large reductions in anxiety and depression were sustained at 8 months follow-up.  \r\n\r\nWe might ask: how does a single dose of this medicine work to effect such profound changes?  To answer this question, I conducted in-depth interviews with our cancer patients.  In their own words, patients describe profound shifts in their physical experience of their bodies, striking changes in their attachments and relationships with loved ones, and catharses of strong emotions, even difficult struggles, which were resolved with the help of the therapy team and the supportive container.  These interviews help us open the \u201cblack box\u201d of psychedelics and explain how such clinical changes are possible.  I will provide a critique of the hypothesis that a single mediator\u2014a traditional \u201cmystical experience\u201d\u2014can account for the complex terrain of psychedelic-assisted practices. Finally, I\u2019ll review the \u201croots and fruits\u201d of alleged mystical experience.  In a study at the University of Pennsylvania, we empirically tested the assertion that drug-induced mystical experiences were \u201cinauthentic\u201d or different in kind from spontaneous mystical experiences.  The emergence of a psychedelic practice in contemporary medicine and culture raises boundary-crossing questions about the nature of knowledge and human experience: just where does science leave off and the mystical begin?",

        "description": "As above, so below: maps of the Internet look like maps of the inter-species symbiosis in a forest, which look like maps of the functional connections in an LSD-inspired brain. And evidence is stacking up that psychoactive plants have played a major role in the development of language, art, and culture \u2013 not just for human beings, but across the biosphere.  \r\n\r\nAnd as within, so without: the dragons on the edge of our maps are turning into Pok\u00e9mon in AR gaming; our science fiction narratives of de-extincted dinosaurs are looking likelier each day with radical advances in genetic engineering.  \r\n\r\nThanks to the psychedelic (\"mind manifesting\") power of our Promethean technologies, our dreams and fears have never been so fast to manifest as they are now.  It is time for us to take a long, hard look at what might be, if ANYTHING is possible. \r\n\r\nWhat did the psychedelic revolution of the 1960s teach us about how to handle the immense and terrifying pace of change these days?  Tim Leary said PCs would be the next LSD \u2013 and, in fact, it was their visionary journeys that they thank for inspiration, almost all the masterminds of the computing revolution.  So maybe there is something to the notion that the insights from psychedelic psychotherapy and of indigenous plant medicine traditions are just what the doctor ordered to help navigate this age's waves of great accelerating transformations.  \r\n\r\nJoin paleontologist-futurist Michael Garfield on a whirlwind tour through an age \"indistinguishable from magic\" \u2013 and a lighthearted but deadly serious examination of the responsibility of bringing new life forms and minds into this world as parents in our psychedelic century.\r\n\r\nWatch Michael's lightning presentation of this talk at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Innovation Lab:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfjnWkDwYrc\r\nView the slideshow for this talk:\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/tech-ethics-as-7956513",

She has a BA in Ecology from New College of Florida, a school that explicitly values ecstatic wonder. She was in a PhD program for Integrative Conservation, but left after realizing that humanity\u2019s socioecological crises won't be solved by data alone: we need better tools for looking at hard problems with self-compassion, and for communicating and coordinating to co-create solutions. She writes about these topics, as well as psychedelic integration, at pricklesandgoo.com. \r\n\r\n \r\nThese places where reason and spirituality come into conflict can provide fertile ground for cultivating new ways of understanding and relating. If we can turn towards the tensions that arise when our existing belief structures are not able to meet our needs, we can find opportunities to help those frameworks grow and expand. I want to make spaces where we can allow our sense of the sacred to encompass the deep and beautiful metaphors that science has discovered, and where we can allow our need for analytical understanding to take in the complexity and uncertainty of the world in all its rich variety.",

        "description": "After many requests for lessons and tips, Mistress Jade will be debuting Spanking 101, a class for first-timers, curious lovers, and fetishists who want to embrace their love of BDSM. Learn the basics of spanking, paddling, flogging, and whipping. During the class, participants will study how to gently bind, blindfold, gag, and/or prepare their partner for a round of loving smacks, whips, and spanks. Engage in sensual play designed to express love through pain and power tactics. Understand the difference between doms and subs and discover your true nature in the realm of BDSM. Mistress Jade will personally guide each couple in how to manipulate, treat, and care for their bodies and how to avoid hurt and confusion during play. Materials will be provided, but feel free to bring your own love instruments to class. \r\n\r\nMistress Jade runs a tight ship. There is a strict hassle-free class rule: no threatening, close-minded, or rude participants will be allowed to stay. Check all your expectations and predispositions at the door. All students can expect a safe, supportive, and encouraging atmosphere. But beware, you WILL give and receive some loving pain, and you will always thank your hostess and your partners when doing so. Now don't be late! There will be a price to pay...that only your sweet bottom can afford!",

Our Live DJ's will create a space where you can get lost, found, centered or just astral project...no shit, it's happened. \r\n\r\nIf you arrive at 10AM you'll catch the Random Pants morning yodel followed by a champagne toast - basically you get to dance, drink, and then stretch before heading off to lunch, bike exploration, or a mid day nap.

Although this conservative tennis club will be disciplining anyone who breaks the Wimbledon all-white outfit policy, passes may be granted based on \"who you know\". Knowing the right people may even lead to a \"no shirt, no shoes, no problem\" attitude. LRC members will have a lemonade and pop tart stand set up during the entertainment. During intermissions, croquet competitions will be arranged on an ad-hoc basis for athletes who prefer sports that do not result in drink spillage.",

Trey Ratcliff here for the 8th photo walk - Sooo excited!\r\n\r\nDo you like taking photos or perhaps do you like people taking photos of you in all your fabuloso Burner gear? Well come on out and join this fun event - all are welcome! \ud83d\ude42 It's great for beginner photographers all the way to advanced - bring anything from a mobile phone to a DSLR! We'll roam the streets of BRC and capture some of the magic of Burning Man together. \r\n\r\nI'll be giving lots of tips and tricks to help you on your own creative journey. We also talk a lot about the creative process and how it can be quite an active meditation bringing more consciousness, presence, and awesomeness into your life. So, come, bring a friend or three, and let's have a ball. Word has it that we'll get a bunch of Burner Girls too that just dance around and have thousands of photos taken of them. You know the type. Good times.\r\n\r\nAnd after, we'll share all the photos in the Facebook event at https://goo.gl/PGy7Qq . Check the comments in the event to make some new Instagram friends with fellow photo walkers too! \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\nWe'll meet outside of Center Camp TUESDAY at 6 PM and start the crawl from there!",

The lighting of this Sacred Fire marks the opening of our week-long ceremony at Burning Man. Learn to appreciate fire during our ceremony together? Learn to work with the spirit of the fire? How will you carry this prayer forward through this week of ceremony and Radical Ritual and back to your communities? How will you keep your own Sacred Fire lit? How will you continue to shine your light in the darkness? Fire feeds the seeds of intention of what we seek to call forth. Fire is also a purifier. Send everything that no longer serves you into your own Sacred Fire to purify your heart, body, mind, and soul. Open this year with a Radical Ritual and hold your prayer through the burn and bring it back to your community.",

The therapeutic potentials of compounds such as ayahuasca, ibogaine, psilocybin, MDMA, and ketamine are being explored as treatment for conditions such as PTSD, depression, addiction, end of life anxiety and more. These plants, fungi, and chemicals are an expression of the vis medicatrix naturae, and have been used by humans around the world for millennia to facilitate access to non-ordinary states of consciousness and healing. Through a look at indigenous traditions, proposed mechanisms of therapeutic action, and scientific research, we will examine the potential that psychedelics hold for the future of medicine and the role that health care providers and consumers can play in this evolutionary process.",

        "description": "Making drinking plans for your camp? Do those plans include lots and lots of aluminum cans? Want to unload all those empty cans on playa while also helping the kids of Gerlach? \r\n\r\nWell then come on down to Recycle Camp and SHOW US YOUR CANS! At Recycle Camp we will take all of your aluminum cans of your hands as part of our gift to the playa. We are located directly behind the Center Camp Caf\u00e9 on 6:00 and are open every day 9am to 5pm. Please no drop offs: participate! When you get there, we will help you quickly separate your cans before riding THE CRUSHINATOR, our magical bicycle-powered can crushing apparatus that crushes your cans flat so we can store as many as possible before scrapping the aluminum off-site. All of the money we generate from aluminum recycling is donated directly to the Gerlach school system. Everybody wins!\r\n\r\nWe can only accept ALUMINUM cans. Please no glass, plastic, steel, or tin cans, so please keep all of your water bottles, tetrapaks, soup cans, and coconut waters separated. A good rule of thumb for figuring out if something is aluminum: if you can't crush it by hand, then we don't want it! Some stout beers like Guinness also have a plastic widget inside that cannot be recycled with the aluminum, please remove it beforehand or we can show you how. \r\n\r\nPROTIP from the Recyclenaut Aluminati: bring a MESH bag to collect all of your cans in. Plastic garbage bags don't allow your cans to dry out and create a foul, sticky sludge. If you store them in a mesh bag before bringing them over to Recycle Camp it helps make things a little less juicy for you when we they get sorted and crushed. Be smart, plan ahead, Recycle Camp wants YOU to come CRUSH it with us!!!",

Too often, it seems a supreme form of duplicity, a sly attempt to excite another person and derive gratification from their interest without any corresponding wish to go to bed with them. It looks like a manipulative promise of sexual affection that, at the last moment, leaves its targets confused and humiliated. In our sadness, back home alone after the nightclub or the party, we may rail against the flirt for \u2018only\u2019 flirting, when it had appeared there would be so much more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this kind of pattern represents only one, unedifying and regrettable possibility around flirting.\"\r\n\r\n\"At its best, flirting can be a vital social process that generously lends us reassurance and freely redistributes confidence and self-esteem. The task is not to stop flirting, but to learn how better to practice its most honorable versions.\"\r\n\r\nHonest Flirt is a game that gives you all the practice you need.  \r\n\r\nStop by any time between sunrise and 10 PM.\r\n\r\nYou can find the complete essay on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZTqF5oYUqo",

The results were so  potent that David adapted many of the exercises to share in groups.\r\n\r\nIn groups, we focus on generating intimacy, emotional openness, and physical bonding in a safe, slow, guided non-sexual way. We reawaken our primal need for human connection, animal to animal, body to body, heart to heart, without the stress or uncertainty of sex. By trusting our bodies and each other, we reclaim our original innocence... and remember we are safe.\"",

Like the markings of our abode and circuitry, we want to share with you the beauty of our patterns through body paint so that you may reflect the beauty of being biologic robot. We understand running on high energy most days can get our systems overheated. With essential oils, we will teach you how to cool your system, while using this technique to blend into the current human population with natural smell. Lube up your connective joints and re-energize your circuitry through inhaling oxygen and extending your hydraulics through breathing, meditation, and poses drawn from an ancient human practice called Yoga. Refuel and keep your batteries fully charged by making a long pit stop at this refueling center.",

        "description": "Rituals Arts Collective's 'Sailing the Dead Seas: Rockin' the Boats!' installation is anchored in our childhood; you'll see a flotilla of oversized, whimsical, origami-like colorful 'paper boats,' each floating upon its 'waves.' Each boat is actually a teeter totter, ready to be rocked by the participants. As every craft has environmental sensors installed within, you'll hear incredible, albeit low-key musical tones, as 'played' by the wind, and motion of the boats. The effect is bio-elemental, aural soothing of our minds. Participants will find the interior of the (easily accessible) boats gilded in silver and gold, filled with inspirational quotes to complete the experience. Each ship/shrine has materials to write 'notes of hope' and means of containing these utterances by attendees (Truth be told, these boats act as walk-aboard shrine(s) to inspire Burning Man attendees to leave notes for us to burn off-playa in a ceremony, so their wishes may be granted to the winds after the Burning Man event. ;) The reason for 'Dead Seas' in the title is twofold: the playa's dry lake bed, and the actual Dead Sea in Jordan-- both have high mineral content, that which nourishes souls who 'float' in it. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s NOT all! ;o)\r\n\r\nThere be CHRISTENINGS, Ye Mateys! Help us christen our boats at the Playa Art Park and on the Playa itself!\r\n\r\nMonday, 1:00 pm: \r\n\r\nOur lead ship will be christened, and bubbly cider and water will be served to all #Land Pirates that attend! (But of course, bring yer cups and while supplies last! ;)\r\n\r\nTuesday, 1:00 pm: \r\n\r\nOur first flotilla of ships on the playa will be christened, and bubbly cider and water will be served to all #Land Pirates that attend! (But of course, bring yer cups and while supplies last! ;)\r\n\r\nWednesday, 1:00 pm: \r\n\r\nOur second flotilla of ships on the playa will be christened, and bubbly cider and water will be served to all #Land Pirates that attend!

Specific musical instruments played during the meditation allow participants to use sound as a therapeutic tool to disconnect from discursive thinking and delve into a transcendental state. The goal is to enable participants to disengage their undesirable habitual patterns and to empower positive cognitive change. Most of the instruments used in a Sound Meditation are overtone-emitting instruments such as gongs, Tibetan singing bowls, bells, metallic discs, etc. These instruments have been used in meditation and sound healing for centuries in many cultures and continue to be used.\r\nAlexandre has conducted ethnomusicology fieldwork for 18 years in over 40 countries. His research investigates issues of acculturation, community, musical identity in an urban setting, and the concepts of talent, charisma, and leadership in music.",

The flow wand (aka levitation stick) is a flow prop that is inspired from a classic magic trick called the \"Dancing Cane\".  It is a cleverly balanced stick with a thin, invisible string somewhere in the middle that is also attached to the to the magician.  The magician appears to control the cane with his mind, the cane seemingly floating in mid-air, while making it dance to music.  Recently the Flow wand was introduced into the juggling community, so in this workshop you can learn everything to get started with this magical prop.",

I have no interest in contributing to the thousands of forgetable \"selfies\" that will be done that week.  I will try to photograph you as best as I can and make an interesting portrait of you.  If all you can do is stand there and re do your high school graduation photo then that is what you will get.\r\nHOWEVER, if you approach the photograph with an open mind and a willingness to try to help me make something interesting you will be rewarded with something unique.\r\nPlease come by, relax in our shade structure, look over prints from previous years, possibly get inspired and most importantly get your portrait done.",

But a negotiation is also successful if it helps to avoid an unwanted outcome, so we also discuss how to convince someone to go away. B.E.D. values the right of individual choice, which includes the right to choose NOT to have sex.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t care what gender you appear to be, or what gender you claim to be, or what kinds of partners you prefer. What matters is communication and consent. All are welcome to attend this \"Clarity and Consent Playshop\" presented by the Bureau of Erotic Discourse - at RhythmWave!",

As they play with the widgets, patterns of light appear on the cone, surrounding the Participants with a dazzling color spectacle of their own creation and rewarding their curiosity.\n\nIllumicone is 19 feet tall at its center and 38 feet across at its base.  Cables descending from the top of the cone carry 3600 individually controlled LEDs. Inside the cone are interactive widgets constructed mostly out of repurposed objects. Manipulating the widgets causes patterns of light to appear and move across the LEDs. Spinning wooden wheels causes stripes to move around the cone and collide to create seemingly random combinations of color. Other widgets create sparkles, stain the cone with blotches that expand and disappear, or twist and turn the whole display.",

Clich\u00e9 as it sounds, in a world where nothing seems to make sense anymore, love still does. Of course love can be so many different things to different people. As an artist, it was capturing that unexpected moment when love is first revealed that got my own heart beating fast. But the more I thought about it, the more I had to ask myself: aren't we all artists when it comes to creating, finding and nurturing love? That curiosity has now taken shape in the form of a 20 x 6 x 6-foot interactive sculpture . Participants will literally be given the opportunity to \"find love\" by walking around the sculpture until they find the one spot where the letters come together. They'll also be encouraged to contribute their dedications, discoveries, personal stories and thoughts on love via notes to deposit into the sculpture.",

Excitingly in this mode they can except and receive stimuli directly from the brains of other organisms to continue their developmental journey unto their ultimate future self.  \n\nWill you give or receive? Change or be changed?  This psychic artistic conceptual spit swap on an Alpha wave level will surely be a unique and memorable experience.",

It improves infinitely with wear, becoming something burnished, something better.  Sometimes water is the agent of change, wearing down the edges and smoothing over the brittleness of its natural state. Other times stone is worn by centuries of human footsteps, traveling the long roads to market, to worship, to home.  The tops of these tables are ancient granite stair blocks; their worn surfaces bear witness to 600-900 years of architectural service.   Collected and re-purposed, these blocks are crafted into useful objects meant to sit at the heart of human exchange. \r\n\r\nRhodes adds, \"Like much of my work, Lithic Altars sit at the crossroads of architecture and sculpture. They inhabit a gray between monumental and intimate not frequently explored.\"",

It is a mysterious little grove which has a life on its own, but every participant who steps inside contributes directly to the feedback of the installation - just like a forest organically interacts with its inhabitants. \r\nAlthough a mirage of electronic nature, the grove aims to illustrate the imprint and connections everyone has to each other and their surroundings.",

This installation, featuring both chicken and eggs, takes the traditional riddle and turns it into a giant art object focused on the immediate experience of play. It has a smooth curvilinear metal framework in the shape of a huge chicken, with a cage of tubular steel hoops forming the body and a large circular opening at the rear, which Burners climb into via a ladder. Inside there is a pile of gigantic leather-covered foam eggs that they can lie on and hug and frolic about in. The activities of the Participants themselves turn the installation into performance art. Aesthetically it is a shape of great purity and simplicity, emphasizing the ovoid and symbolising fertility. The artwork is the creative expression of a paradox that has exercised philosophers and scientists for centuries \u2013 Which came first, the chicken or the egg?",

It has seven levels that reach 35 ft. high, each level with projecting decorative wings encircling it. \r\n\r\nFrom a distance, the wings create a feeling of lightness, while the dome as a whole conveys a rooted presence. Participants enter the Temple through one of thirteen sizable inverted \"V\" openings. Inside is a welcoming, vaulted, airy interior defined by a series of shrinking, concentric circles soaring overhead. The dome top is left uncovered to allow for the participant's connection with the cosmos. The open interior design incorporates hundreds of shelves lining every wall, as well as several freestanding sub-altars that provide many niches and ledges for objects of remembrance.",

Why call it the \"KAFKA 9.0\"? \r\n\r\nBecause it's a wall, it protects all round, and a wall, even if it seems hard, lends itself to clear vision, both near and far, dominant but not invasive, it envelops without being claustrophobic. \r\n\r\nWhy Kafka? Because with his famous metamorphosis, is pure Alchimia, is the transformation of material into material, and with art it transforms soul into soul. \r\nIt's a passage, a conversation, a way to achieve full knowledge of oneself, and therefore full freedom. \r\n\r\nArt is knowledge, and as such, has to be able to be communicated and have an emotional impact on man, providing food for thought processes and feelings that become a journey, and that's how art transforms, like Alchemy, an Alchemic ritual. \r\nThe installation consists of a decagon with a diameter of about 10m* made up of wooden posts with slanted supports and horizontal planks that, attached at preset heights, support the wooden structures on which to place the art.",

There is not a person today that would be alive if it wasn't for the vagina\u2013 and a wet one at that. The most radical ritual of all is birth, and leading up to that is the ritual of courtship. Without courtship, the Wet Pussy wouldn't come into being. In the world we live in today, the pussy is misused, unused, and abused. The powerful pussy changes one's life and the people of this spiritual world could use a gentle reminder of its omnipotent power; handle with care. Life, like art is a process, and ritual of birth is a process. So we may all pay homage to the radical ritual in which had to take place in order for all of us to be here on the planet. If wet pussy offends you, then the very essence of life offends you and I urge you to go to a women\u2019s march and speak up, but proceed with caution.",

Scientists must envision and study unimaginable forces, distances, and time spans.  Thus a leap of faith through rationality extends experience beyond the realm of our normal senses.  We will show citizens that interstellar radiation has been continually bombarding their own body though beyond their awareness.  The goal of this effort is to engage the Playa explorer with the playful interaction of \"catching\" a cosmic ray; seeing its path through their body. Our desire is to move beyond experiential-based rationality into a more fundamental contemplation of vast scales of time and space and thereby surrender to a realization of our own insignificance.   And if we are insignificant what is the role of our uniqueness and our belief in sacred things? ?  Isn't it absurd to be simultaneously unique and yet totally insignificant?",

On top of her bust she'll have a head wrap that turns into Birds taking flight symbolizing I Rise I Rise Again. Walking up into the back of the open head area will be a mural of her childhood and different phases of her life including her famous poetry readings and interaction touching surfaces with different textures and shapes and discovering hidden pictures under, in, and around things.

One of our artist's brothers died young when he was overcome with cancer related to AIDS. He was a fantastic person and brought so much joy the lives of so many others. One of his most prized possessions included a collection of wooden automata animals.  \r\n\r\nIt is in his memory, and with great joy that we bring these pieces to life in Black Rock City.  The automata will be large interactive sculptures that poke fun at and bring life to the radical rituals of animal playfulness and pleasure.  Five or six free range animals will round out the menagerie.",

As you ride or walk along the phence you will discover a special part of BRC. Chuckle and relate (not a law firm) your way as you negotiate the beauty of the deep playa. Each  sign has a hidden or blatant playa meaning. Feel free to reorient them if the winds have turned them, some have messages on the back intended for the perimeter crew and law enforcement  agencies that patrol outside the phence. A few wind chimes will gently orient you. The Electric Horseman will churn the dust as he does his thing year after year. JustGeorge, CowboyKarl and the Phence crew are the real phence artists out there.  So get out to the deep playa, 'cuz art is in your camps, its on your wheels, its - well its also where you least expect it.

The sign itself is made out of reclaimed sheet metal and discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 ten-watt incandescent bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels (and sometimes, pedal-power) so the piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORING sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, and framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset. With four 500-watt speakers and a playlist of danceables from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the mobile, rolling sign often attracts an entourage of sunset or late night boogie revelers.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/campboring",

Here we teach of meteorites and pass them from hand to hand. Here we discuss science in all its forms and weave a tapestry of how and where and why that enlightens and inspires. And what is that, if not the very core of art?\r\n \r\nOur main telescope is a Dobsonian with a 20\" mirror, larger than many permanent public observatories.

An homage to Cadillac Ranch.  In 1974 the artists collaborative Ant Farm buried ten Cadillacs in the Texas prairie, leaving only the tail fins visible.  Cadillac Ranch has come to symbolize the demise of the dinosaurs that brought the American automobile industry to the brink of extinction.  The emergence of the nose-section of a zero-emissions vehicle turns the image of Cadillac Ranch on its head.  It suggests that, after a transformational journey through the bowels of earth, the automobile is being reborn as an environmentally-friendly descendant of gas-guzzling ancestors. \nhttps://www.instagram.com/electricrenaissance/",

        "description": "\"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.\"\r\n-Nikola Tesla\r\n\r\nTherolin No.1 is a study of electromagnetic and acoustic vibrations resulting in a radical new musical instrument. A 20 foot length of steel pipe acts as the sounding box, while a theramin antenna at the end controls a series of electromagnets that actuate a strand of piano wire within.  It is designed to be minimal and unassuming, while still having an intriguing presence. Participants will be drawn in by its form, and only upon closer inspection will they discover something completely unexpected and wonderful. As they get close to or reach out to touch the end of the pipe, they will notice a soft musical sound starting to emit. If they move their hand closer to the antenna, the pitch of the sound will rise, and as they move their hand away the pitch will fall. The experience will be the interface of a traditional theramin, but with a more real, physical sound.",

All of us are searching for something in life. People will go around the world and back again without realizing that what they want is actually already quite close to them. Whether it's happiness, health, wealth, or wisdom, this installation aims to challenge your perception on self empowerment. I invite you to look in the mirror and reflect. \r\n\r\nThis installation encourages us to stop looking to the world to give you whatever it is we're looking for. The beauty of life is that your destiny lies always in your hands, and the answers are within. Look no further, Everything you need is inside you .",

There are four benches around the art allowing Black Rock City citizens to sit, gather, discuss the art, or just relax on their journey across the Playa.  \n\nI would hope the piece sparks discussion on being your true self, to open up to all aspects of life and what it has to offer.  In short, to come out of the corner you may be in and stand in the light of life.  Feel your Bliss.",

Upon this vessel are chimes and harp strings connected to resonating chambers and long creature like aluminum appendages that dangle from above and give voice to the wind. Perhaps it's a gateway to whatever one sees beyond the confines of physical reality. A place to walk through and re imagine, an invitation to pass through from one dimension to another. From past to future, from old to new, from this to that or nothing at all. Just an offering to the wind.",

It is a rotating contraption inspired by the 1890s \"Kaiser Panorama\", only in reduced table-top form.  \r\n\r\nAlongside the viewer is a bench (doubling as a storage unit) where Participants waiting to use the viewer can hang out while looking at additional 3d-cards using hand-held viewers. The entire piece is a work of art and craftsmanship, dedicated to the exhibition of another art form, stereo-photography. For its inaugural outing, it will feature the work of stereophotographers, or \"stereoburners\", who have recorded Burning Man over the last 20 years.",

The whole structure has a reflective, metallic surface that absorbs its surroundings and allows the structure to partially dissolve into the landscape. The curves of the dome and pipes however, distort the reflections that bounce off the structure giving the user an augmented view of the surrounding environment.\n\nAn interactive LED system brings the project to life and turns the structure into a hub of celebration during night hours. The lighting together with a specifically designed soundscape allow the user to emerge into a vivid sensory experience of emotion and technology.",

Stylized giants appear as a ghostly dance of familiar yet mysterious shapes. \r\n\r\nFrom a distance the forms entice participants to wonder, and drawing nearer, the shapes may appear as intriguing possibilities of what they represent, Branchinecta sp. The fairy shrimp are constructed of rip-stop nylon, and float affixed to bamboo poles. The individual sculptures are around 12' long and 4' in diameter. They represent the very real and very tiny creatures underfoot. They emerge here to dance in unison with the wind.  When there is no wind, there is rest, and maybe some slight shade. Here is existence of a temporary nature - as fairy shrimp: to eat, to dance, to mate, and to enjoy each other's company before our pool dries up, again.",

The tessellated surface of the Dung Ball isn't exactly round and in combination with kinetic legs the bug has an articulated and lifelike movement as it clunkily moves along the playa. At night, the bug will utilize pixel-mapped LED lighting and starcaster lights to illuminate its travel path and inner workings. The starcaster lights are a nod to how wild dung beetles use the moon, stars, and Milky Way to safely travel in the dark.",

This participatory installation will offer a safe and sacred space for pilgrims to be invited to shed obsolete patterns of all kinds. where in our world are we invited to behave this way? Usually these emotions are held invisibly on purpose, or else surface in unconscious ways. \r\n\r\nThis altar provides a permissive environment to expose oneself, privately or publicly, and even be encouraged to go deeper into exploring and letting go of resentments or attachments, things we once needed as coping mechanisms, but are now obsolete, yet we may never have purged them from our brain's hard drive. Time to clear space for new healing, new life force and space for new inspirations and ways of being in the world.",

What emotion is represented by climbing an attached ladder that leads to nowhere? There are multiple doors that cannot be opened, why? Is something trapped inside or is someone merely shutting something out? Knobs and valves can be turned and opened, light switches can be turned on and off; all similar to our key emotion of arousal and sexuality. \r\n\r\nThere is a dark void within the pyramid; it will feel empty and look dark just like many of our natural emotions of loneliness. A large mirror is placed at the correct height to reflect a persons beauty; or does it only show ugliness? Ideas and thoughts are fleeting ideas, just like a touch light represents by tapping to illuminate. Every square inch of the pyramid is covered with something tactile or covered with bright colors.",

The signs foster the ethos of global consciousness with wise words, connected statements, and enlightening messages that promote positive thought and inspire an inner dialogue. The beauty of these installations is that it is for everyone: public art in its purist form; a series of affirmations- relevant to all of us, applicable on so many levels. It is the intent that everyone on their unique journeys will have an opportunity to be touched by a seemingly serendipitous message. All people \u2013 no matter how divergent their concerns, no matter how fragile or empowered they are \u2013 will be able to experience it and perhaps, receive the message they needed to see.\r\n \r\n\"Art is only real when shared.\"",

A battery-powered strobe is attached to the frame right above the altar, flashing once every minute, illuminating the altar and whoever else happens to be interacting with it.\r\n\r\nThe skull is surrounded by thick, convoluted layers of impenetrable metal, symbolizing our reality tunnels, often as thick, convoluted and impenetrable. The altar is a contemplation on the artist's reality tunnel; albeit not a gloomy one - after all, the skull is looking out onto the open playa and Black Rock City citizens, who happen to be interacting with the altar.",

In ritual that stretches back before humans \u2013 and that also anticipates a future when they don't exist \u2013 the sidhe revel in the endless cycle of light and dark. The court bursts from the Otherworld, and bystanders see a dark figure with pulsing veins of red light and a silver face that reflects a person's soul, followed by cavorting figures who tap on many drums. \r\n\r\nIn caricature of the Pied Piper leading children astray, some of the sidhe beat a march, while other figures dart among onlookers, drawing bystanders in as the group strides toward ritual stations of drum and light. The court \u2013 and its new attendants \u2013 pound a rhythm as the sun sinks below the horizon towards the inevitable transformation of light to dark. The sidhe and its new court howl in joy as the sun drops past the skyline, and the blessed cool of night bathes the land in its embrace.",

The tree's roots form benches on which Burners can congregate.\r\n\r\nAncestry and evolution are central themes for our work, whose namesake's rings and branches bore witness to the entire span of recorded human history. Great trees gave their limbs and leaves as axles, paper, bows, hulls and roofs, and held space and time for our ancestors' radical rituals.  \r\n\r\nBlack Rock City contains many altars of dance and ecstasy, and many more of learning and relaxation, but the city provides comparatively few spaces for contemplation and remembrance.  \r\n\r\nCircular spaces, lone trees and eternal flames are all strong ritualistic symbols and joining them in Methuselah helps to dislocate Participants from the frenzy of present day time and re-anchors them in the still time of mythology.",

Throughout the Sierra Nevada, species of pine trees are dying, compromised by a bark beetle which has proliferated due to human interruption of the cycle of forest fires, and climate change. The material of these trees, donated to our project, harvested and milled, becomes the basic building block of the Temple. Interlocking timber pieces in formation become a Temple that is both cloud and spire; inverted pyramidal columns suggest the negative-space of a forest canopy, simultaneously supporting a vast pagoda-like 'cloud' framework which in turn supports a central spire. In this way disorder gives way to harmony, and a group of dying trees is re-ordered into a cathedral of timbers stretching toward the sky; filtered sun rays will illuminate the intricate work of hundreds of hands building in unison; a collaboration that knits together a community as roots intertwine to give a healthy forest stability.",

As you make your way around fallen trusses towards a mysterious altar in the middle of the structure, you'll see threatening clouds and an offering to the gods of industry, along with the handle to a mysterious crank that could have something to do with a kinetic automaton.  What happens when you turn the crank?  Why has industry sucked all color and sound out of this place?  \r\n\r\nOnce the clouds part and a giant finger has accepted or rejected the offering, faint music starts to play and lights start to shine out of the slats in a garage at the back of the structure.  Drawn to the light, you walk towards it and notice that things start to have color and substance.  Entering the garage, you will find a replica of the original oscillator used in the soundtrack to Fantasia, and learn about the founding of Silicon Valley.",

The crew suffers from Chronophasia, a form of dissociative amnesia, onset by continuous time travel. Their unique memory loss allows them to see the present without reference to the past or future; eliminating the influence that the concept of linear time would otherwise have on their interactions. These unsuspecting chrononauts are going wherever and whenever the time machine takes them next. Their collections and stashes of pseudoscientific clutter contain clues to solving a sci-fi mystery representative of the anti-ritual, the unfounded, and unexplainable. The time machine, its creation, and current state speak not of new beginnings or rebirth, but a blank slate where freedom from tradition can allow the individual to discover, authentically, the profound and enlightening experiences from which rite and ritual are born.",

All three are supported by platforms, allowing a single participant to look underneath them and even put their head up in to them, revealing a space of personal worship.\r\n\r\nThe insides of the micro-cathedrals are decorated in traditional fashion, with respect to each of their belief systems.  Stained-glass windows adorn the walls.  Music evocative of each faith plays softly over concealed speakers.

        "description": "The project of Vasiliy Shchetinin \"Makhalych\" (Birding Man) is a rebirth of his personal art character \"Ikarushka\" whose history begins in 1989.\r\n\r\nMost renown object showcased at the First International Festival of Street Theaters 1989 USSR (\"Caravan of fools\", Moscow-Paris, curated by Slava Polunin). A hyper-realistic figure dressed like author, hanged on wings 12 meters width, became a main symbol of the festival.\r\n\r\nThe early version of the object symbolizes an image or a romantic freak, looser. The new one, offered for your reference, tends more for the thematic of overcoming, challenge, reaching for new horizons.\r\n\r\nPhilosophical and artistic concept refers to a number of images that are widely recognizable , archetypical, classical. Ikarus and similar characters of myths and legends, Vitruvian man and Leonardo daVinci flying machines sketches, utopian imaginary of Russian Avant-garde, Soviet Constructivism, and contemporary kinetic art.",

The open text contain series of colored dots in rows, corresponding to colored buttons. Pressed in sequence, lights darken, then begin to rise up the columns.\r\n\r\nTurning pages, pressing buttons, each page a ritual of motion necessary to light the shrine. For each 'ritual' the lights respond differently. Participants each control 1/6 of the lights. Working together, the intricacy of pattern increases. Combining sequences unlocks more colors & patterns. \r\n\r\nWhile not intended to represent any one form of worship, it contains elements of many. Faith, religion & spirituality are all related, a veneration of the source of the light that allows us to see the Universe around us.",

The family of Black Bart ( The famous Wells Fargo stage coach robber) gave the gun handle to add to Claude. He also has the ashes of the late Great Buck Dan Jones welded into a oil fitting. There is a oven door on his right side to access  the inside where we become the Wizard of Oz. There is a steering wheel and nematic levels so his head turns and goes up and down. His mouth opens and he breathes fire. The operator can  look out of the scales to communicate with participants. We are looking forward to seeing everyone at home.",

While it worked very well in it's intended purpose, we were also overwhelmed by people who just wanted to DRAW.  At all hours of the day and night people were drawing like crazy on this 4 ft. by 8 ft. blank canvas.  We are trying to make a way for that same energy to be expressed in 12 to 14 different locations around Black Rock City this year.

In a belief that thought begets matter, this ceremony gives us an opportunity to imagine an amelioration of the \"Man\" of the future.  What is his greatest potential? What would his leadership be like?  How will he be?   -This shrine is built in honor of ancient wisdom teachings of the Andes in the form of a Ayni Despacho - a sacred care package is created for Mother Earth in gratitude for sacred reciprocity to all that exist.  Symbolic organic offerings are part of the sculpture and consist of mountains for places of power/wisdom, Ouroboros spiral for the perpetual cyclic renewal of life and infinity, sweets for Love, bark for plant relatives, raisins for ancestors, anise for celebration/sensuality and various raw material. A ritual feeding in the form of seed replicas will be placed on the shrine for citizens of Black Rock City to imbue their intention of Man's Becoming . . .",

Guardian of the scavengers, the All Mother invites those who feel her calling to spend some time reflecting on life from death/death from life, and the balance between. She encompasses all. Graced with a blend of gory and delicately beautiful features, reflecting upon the true grit and glory of the world today. Brass and bone are the heartbeat of her imagery. Surrounded by amulets found and collected, true treasures, the goddess desires to be adored with relics that possess the power of life and eternal love. She does not shy from any certain energy and accepts all. Be you strong, weak, bold, meek, loved, enlightened, or lost, visit this goddess for salvation.",

All around the center piece you can see typical (and not so typical...) objects offered by passers and devotees.\n\nIt is said that Gauchito Gil deserted a war he did not believe in. For this he was beheaded, but before passing, he instructed his executioner to pray in his name. The executioner got home to find his son very ill and prayed to Gauchito for help. You can imagine the rest... Yes! it\u00b4s a miracle! The boy regained good health and Gauchito slowly and steadily became a Rockstar level miracle performer\n\nWhat you are seeing is a tribute to popular belief, the outlaws and the power of faith, in whatever form or shape it may come.",

Each boat is actually a teeter totter, ready to be rocked by the participants. As every craft has environmental sensors installed within, you'll hear incredible, albeit low-key musical tones, as 'played' by the wind, and motion of the boats. The effect is bio-elemental, aural soothing of our minds. They'll find the interior of the (easily accessible) boats gilded in silver and gold, filled with inspirational quotes to complete the experience. Each ship/shrine has materials to write 'notes of hope' and means of containing these utterances by attendees. The reason for 'Dead Seas' in the title is twofold: the playa's dry lake bed, and the actual Dead Sea in Jordan-- both have high mineral content, that which nourishes souls who 'float' in it.",

From a single viewing position, all pieces of the image align to create a flat, unified portrait of the Hindu deity Ganesha.\n\nIn Hindu tradition, Ganesha is the deity tasked with removing obstacles and creating good fortune.  As powerful as faith can be, however, most obstacles will not be overcome by faith alone.  It requires some level of human intervention.  This often requires a willingness to look at the problem from multiple different perspectives.  Once you have examined the impediment from varying points of view, the path forward becomes much clearer.",

Dusty denizens stroll through the field of light.\r\n\r\nAmbient ethereal sound filters through the air, layered NASA space recordings: interstellar plasma whirls, lightning from Jupiter, deep-bass starlight waves, Saturn's melodic hum.    \r\n\r\nThree microphones stand ready, adding human voice to the mix. As people sing, speak or whisper into the mics, the hovering illuminated rings respond, matching color and intensity to vocal rhythms. \r\n\r\nAs midnight nears, people patiently watch the horizon, as each of the Big Dipper's seven stars slowly glides into center-point alignment inside the illuminated rings. Midnight ritual ensues: a learned astronomer opens minds and hearts to cosmic wonder in a guided meditative tour of the night sky.",

I will bring some kind of film project to playa every year. In this simple design of 5 vintage televisions and 5 vintage wooden chairs sitting in front of them for individual consumption. Each television will play an original film with the through line of or theme of Radical Ritual. The films' footage will be accumulated by a number of artists to create 5 short films touching on ritual and how it frees us, or how it imprisons us, how it brings us comfort, how it gives us anxiety.",

This piece approaches the cosmological understanding of creation and being as viewed through the lens of Plato's Timaeus, wherein the Demiurge (or Craftsperson) is understood for transforming ideas (Ideals) into reality. Just as the Demiurge created the universe, so will Participants in this installation be able to help create a facet of the Burning Man reality and world by interacting with a display that shifts in various modes of communication (symbols, colors, movement) relative to movement. Both the installation and the Participants will evolve and change as a result of each other, creating a microcosm of a universal approach towards growth and creativity. \r\n\r\nThe installation is comprised of three major parts: a canvas of changing colors that represents the collective unconscious, the dynamically-changing display inspired by the Mind, and the sensors wherein participants interact in reality.",

Sometimes crossing a bridge happens as a rite of passage.  Sometimes one is stuck forever at a door that never opens, grieving for a dream that is never granted. However there is always the eternal return to the bridge, an endless yearning to travel across into a better, brighter place.  We are like plants in the soil that always strive to reach for the sun.\r\n\r\nTHE CAGE stages the fact that we're trapped by profound ignorance and limited cognitive capacity. We're trapped by our need for absolute  good and evil. Our human choices lead us into vulnerability and into natural disaster. We are surprised at our suffering, when this is history of the world.",

With a blur of speed and a trail of dust, the themed trikes and costumed racers circle past fevered spectators demonstrating the power of the electric drives.

The probe may have come from a different planet, from the future or from a different plane of probability. Its origins will be decided by the Burners who visit the Probe on the Playa and interact with it.  \n\nThe structure stands 32 feet tall (including antennas) is highly interactive and has a number of key technologies built into it.  These include a highly sophisticated lighting system and the ability to send targeted messages directly to a library of exoplanets around the universe. The initial vision for the structure came from a recurring dream that the lead artist has had since childhood. It is hoped that Participants who come in contact with the Probability Probe will not only ponder the possibilities of where the Probe has come from but also question where they themselves have come from and what are the different probabilities/possibilities for their own lives.",

It is a shrine, an altar, an homage to spirituality and the rituals that connect us.\n\nLight Years Away has a powerful presence. It is tall and covers a large space. It is geometry, numerology, spirituality, chaos, and nature. It is an homage to the vortex and a harnesser of its mighty power. It is a vessel for hope and grief. Through it one can confess and pray. One can remember and forget. One can whisper a secret or yearn for release. It is a tool for all. It is a tool for many. It is a doorway for all the sadness. For all the hope. It is for us to wield, and for us to revel in, as it is both a doorway to the other side and a doorway into ourselves.",

Moving closer, Black Rock City citizens find their mirror reflections multiplied and fractalized by the convex outer surface of the portal. \r\n\r\nEntering the convex inner portal, citizens find their reflection rearranged and compressed creating a cubist self-portrait. Inside the portal a hallucinatory audio collage designed to complement the citizens's mirror mosaic reflection runs nonstop during the event. An oracle offers the participant his or her appropriate ritualistic suggestion. On top of the portal 3 wind vanes turn in opposite directions creating a flurry of irrelevant motion signifying nothing.",

Upon nearing, it becomes clear that the piece is in sinuous and seductive motion, and that the movements are interconnected from cube to cube; just as ideas, originally thought of as fixed and immutable, become fluid and linked with cooperation and communication.  Viewers participate in creating this movement, and interact with the piece by working together to move the smaller joystick, causing the larger piece to move in a similar fashion.  Coordinated movement is rewarded with fire and lighting effects.  At night, poofers dance in the sky as golden images move on the Playa surface below.",

At sunset everything transforms. The field morphs, bursting into a sea of light reacting to movement and mimicking the fluid almost pulsing nature of the suns corona. \n\nLike in the chromosphere, a magnetic sunspot has informed the pattern of rods, creating patches of pure brightness and areas as mysterious as the inner working of this great star. Zones of tranquillity where the world outside has been blocked out, enable you to lie in a sea of energy, life and light. \n\nSwirling lights blur the line between playa and art breaking down the boundaries of this once unfathomable celestial being",

Lights shining up from within the sculpture along with the moving parts create an ethereal essence. The natural forms rise up from the playa, reaching through, and swaying in the wind. This piece is about the organized functionality of living organisms, in contrast with the disorganization and sometimes seemingly chaotic physical world considered to be reality.",

It will be humbling to enter the booth, and as one sits down to write, or speaks to the silhouette of the confessor across from them, they will not only see a blank slate, but also see how many others sat in the same place before them, filling the wound up scroll with their innermost secrets, seeking absolution and freedom.",

Each individual totem represents one of the three elements of air, earth and water which will be immersed in the fire element of the Burning Man environment. The shrines are comprised of repurposed and originally fabricated traditional instruments from around the world, integrated into a totemic structure, with each totem being characterized by the origin of the sound waves; a column of air (aerophones, i.e. pipe organ) the vibration of the instrument body (idiophone, i.e. bells, cymbals) and tensioned strings (chordophone, i.e. harp). A sculptural space is provided in this work that is made kinetic with the input of the Burning Man participants. It is the instinctual and primal communicative aspect of music that Totem Orchestra taps into in order to draw out people's desire for improvisational expression.",

Closer still, you realize that some people are reading, some are writing.  As you walk up to it you see that each side has a sign on it: \"This side was written on at POrtalBurn\" and \"This side was written on at Playa del Fuego\".  You realize that the Tower is a traveling time capsule that fosters communication.  It has traveled to eight different events in the North East United States.  Each side has a different personality.  You mount the Tower and quickly get engrossed in the art and the prose.  You notice that there is a little bin of colored markers.  You grab one and carry it with you as you wander up and around the Tower, waiting for that inspirational message to spark a reaction.  Time passes, you don't realize how high up you've climbed until you stop and turn, and see the view....and then the epiphany hits you.",

From the unprompted assembly of molecules that led to life, to the behavior of social communities, the ability for an individual to react to change through the influence of those around it contributes to a spontaneous behavior of a larger group without a single leader. \r\n\r\nAs Participants climb onto the sculpture and cause it to move and to sound, their influence on each other, in combination with the sense of interspecies communication inherent in causing the bird to sing, creates a spontaneous ritual behavior that leads to group cohesion. Like a bird murmuration and a school of fish, the forms of the sculpture (made up of smaller bird and fish forms) hint at the remarkable ability of many individuals to maintain cohesion as a group in highly uncertain environments and with limited, noisy information.",

        "description": "La Victrola is a 30-foot tall wood and steel sculpture celebrating the music of a bygone era. Built by a community of volunteer artists at American Steel Studios in Oakland California, its period details, \r\nmusical curation, and live performances stand as organic counterpoints to modern digital culture. La Victrola entertains and educates the public by playing crackly forgotten recordings from the early 1900s, a time of great innovation in jazz, blues, bluegrass, and country & western. On select evenings, La Victrola's cabaret stage hosts period appropriate vaudeville and music performances transporting participants back in time.",

        "description": "A 30' tall representation of M\u00facaro, a wise and woody owl. He comes to Black Rock City as the mascot of Puerto Rico and as a testament to the wisdom of all our teachers, the people who (hoo!) inspired us. NiNO is dedicating M\u00facaro to one teacher in particular in Puerto Rico: his mom, Mrs. Hilda Alicea, who taught for more than 45 years inspiring young people to work hard and go for their dreams. \r\n\r\nThis piece is for people to enjoy and have fun. To be transported again, to have a sense of adventure. Participants enter and exit through an opening under one of the wings. Inside the body is a cozy space with high ceilings and a single spiral staircase that journeys through childhood memories. The walls are set-designed to take them back in time and travel through school years as they climb. At the height of the stairs are two ladders for access to and from the top. It is here where they find the focal point - a sweeping view of the playa through M\u00facaro's giant eyes that move with its head as it rotates.",

        "description": "The Story Behind\nIn December 2016, a tragic attack hit near one of the memorial places in Berlin at Ged\u00e4chtniskirche (Church of Memory in the center of the city). A man drove a heavy lorry into the crowded Christmas market. Twelve women and men came to death, others were heavily injured. This incident (which happened near to most of us living in Berlin) inspired us to develop the Shrine of Lost Moments as an art project at Burning Man 2017.\n\nThe Project\nWe all have periods, relationships, or people in our lives that either end or disappear too early, that we have no time to say farewell to or process, or things that we want to end and can\u2019t. Giving these transitions an active place of remembrance and farewell, as a place of transition;\nwe want to create the shrine of lost moments at Burning Man 2017. The lost moment might also be a period or person that you want to embrace and bring back into memory.\n\nThe visitor of the shrine is encouraged to interact and engage: he or she takes a colored piece of cardboard \u2013 the Remembrance Piece. This piece is cut in the form of the tower of the Berlin\u2019s Ged\u00e4chtniskirche (memorial church) and contains the shadow of a person (inspired\nby the shadow of vaporized victims of the Hiroshima-bombing).\n\nPeople can take one of the remembrance pieces and write a name, life period, situation\u2026 they want to remember, embrace or eliminate from their lives. Both positive and burdening memories are welcome. Then, the remembrance piece can be broken in two parts \u2013 a little bit\nlike the identity tag (dog tag) that soldiers carry around their necks when on a mission. The upper part stays with the burner; the lower part will be placed at the shrine \u2013 designed as a colorful \u201ctree of life.\u201d The tree of life will be burned with the attached Remembrance Pieces together with the Man.",
